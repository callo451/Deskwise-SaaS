## Known Limitations

### General

1. **Single Integration**: Only one accounting platform per organization (cannot connect multiple simultaneously)
2. **Historical Data**: Large historical imports (1000+ invoices) may take significant time due to rate limits
3. **Real-time Sync**: Payment sync is not instant (30-minute polling interval)
4. **Custom Fields**: Limited support for platform-specific custom fields

### Platform-Specific

**Xero**:
- Limited to primary organization (multi-organization requires manual switch)
- Cannot create new tax codes via API
- Tracking categories not currently mapped

**QuickBooks**:
- Requires QuickBooks Online Essentials or Plus (not Simple Start)
- Automated Sales Tax must be enabled for accurate tax calculation
- Estimates not available in Simple Start plan

**MYOB**:
- Description field limited to 255 characters (truncated if longer)
- Requires AccountRight Plus/Premier or MYOB Business
- Company file selection required for multi-file accounts
- "Locked by user" conflicts require manual intervention

### Feature Gaps

These features are planned for future releases:

- **Credit Notes**: Not currently synced (workaround: manual entry)
- **Purchase Orders**: Not supported
- **Expenses**: Not synced from platforms
- **Time Tracking**: Not synced (use Deskwise time entries → convert to invoice)
- **Multi-Organization**: Cannot connect different platforms per client
- **Advanced Reporting**: Platform-native reporting only
- **Inventory Sync**: Limited to basic stock quantities
- **Project/Job Mapping**: Not linked to platform projects

## Migration Notes

### From Manual Accounting

If you were previously entering invoices manually in your accounting platform:

1. **Audit Existing Data**: Export invoices and customers from platform
2. **Initial Import**: Use "Import from Platform" to pull existing data into Deskwise
3. **Verify Mappings**: Ensure account and tax codes are correctly mapped
4. **Test Sync**: Create a test invoice and verify it syncs correctly
5. **Enable Auto-Sync**: Turn on automatic sync after successful testing

### From Another ITSM Platform

If migrating from another platform with accounting integration:

1. **Export Historical Data**: Export invoices, clients from old platform
2. **Import to Deskwise**: Use CSV import or API
3. **Initial Sync**: Use "Export to Platform" to push to accounting
4. **Reconcile**: Verify all data synced correctly
5. **Go Live**: Enable auto-sync for new transactions
