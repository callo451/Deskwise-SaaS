## 🎯 Executive Summary

### Current State: Phase 1 Implementation

The existing Projects module is a solid foundation but has **critical gaps**:

❌ **Security:** No RBAC enforcement on API endpoints
❌ **Milestones:** Collection exists, no implementation
❌ **Integration:** No ticket linking, limited time tracking
❌ **UI:** Basic list view only, no Gantt/Kanban
❌ **Governance:** No gates, RAID, or approval workflows
❌ **Resources:** No capacity planning or allocation
❌ **Financials:** No EVM, invoice generation, or profitability

### Target State: Enterprise PPM Platform

A **world-class Project Portfolio Management** platform that delivers:

✅ **ITIL 4 Alignment:** Full lifecycle with PRINCE2 gates
✅ **MSP Excellence:** Client portfolios, contract awareness, cross-client planning
✅ **Seamless Integration:** Tickets, Time, Billing, Assets, Changes
✅ **Advanced Planning:** Gantt charts, critical path, dependencies, resource leveling
✅ **Financial Control:** EVM, budgets, forecasts, invoice generation
✅ **Governance:** RAID registers, gate reviews, approvals, audit trails
✅ **Modern UX:** Multiple views (Gantt/Kanban/List), drag-drop, real-time
✅ **AI-Assisted:** Auto-scheduling, risk prediction, scope impact
✅ **Comprehensive Reporting:** Dashboards for PMs, execs, MSP roll-ups

### Business Impact

**Projected Improvements:**
