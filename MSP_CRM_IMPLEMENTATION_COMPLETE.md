## 🔒 Security & Access Control

**MSP Mode Validation:**
All CRM features include three layers of security:

1. **UI Layer** - Business section hidden for non-MSP orgs in sidebar
2. **API Layer** - All routes validate: `(session.user as any).orgMode !== 'msp'`
3. **Data Layer** - Organization-scoped queries with `orgId` filtering

**Authentication:**
- NextAuth.js session validation on all endpoints
- JWT token includes `orgMode` field
- 401 Unauthorized if no session
- 403 Forbidden if not MSP organization

**Multi-tenancy:**
- Complete data isolation by `orgId`
- All database queries scoped to organization
- No cross-tenant data leakage possible
