## Access & Security

### Where to Find It

1. **Navigate to Settings**
   - Click "Settings" in sidebar
   - Expand "Account Settings" category
   - Click "Organization Account"

2. **Alternative**: Direct URL
   - Go to `/settings/account`

3. **Danger Zone**
   - Scroll to "Danger Zone" section
   - Click "Delete Organization" button

### Security Measures

‚úÖ **Authentication Required**
- Must be logged in with valid WorkOS session
- Uses existing authentication context

‚úÖ **Confirmation Required**
- Must type exact text: "DELETE MY ORGANIZATION"
- Case-sensitive validation

‚úÖ **Multi-Step Process**
- Preview step (can cancel)
- Confirmation step (can go back)
- Execution (cannot stop)

‚úÖ **Audit Trail**
- All deletions logged to `tenant_deletion_audit`
- Includes user ID, timestamp, and results

‚úÖ **Backup Protection**
- Automatic backup before deletion
- 30-day recovery window
- Backup ID provided for support

## Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Preview Test**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to:
   http://localhost:9002/settings/account

   # Click "Delete Organization"
   # Verify preview shows:
   - Organization name
   - Total record count
   - Collection breakdown
   - Backup warning
   ```

2. **Confirmation Test**
   ```bash
   # Click "Proceed to Confirmation"
   # Try typing incorrect text (should show error)
   # Type "DELETE MY ORGANIZATION" (should enable button)
   ```

3. **Validation Test**
   ```bash
   # Test API endpoint directly:
   curl http://localhost:9002/api/admin/tenant-deletion/preview

   # Should return preview data
   ```

### Important Notes for Testing

‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT RUN FULL DELETION IN PRODUCTION WITHOUT BACKUP**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Test on development/staging environments first**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Verify backup creation before enabling in production**

### What Gets Deleted

**MongoDB Data**:
- ‚úÖ All tickets and service management data
- ‚úÖ All projects, tasks, and milestones
- ‚úÖ All knowledge base articles
- ‚úÖ All assets and inventory
- ‚úÖ All client and contact data
- ‚úÖ All billing and contract data
- ‚úÖ All agents and monitoring data
- ‚úÖ All workflows and automation
- ‚úÖ All reports and templates
- ‚úÖ All settings and preferences

**WorkOS Data**:
- ‚úÖ Organization entity
- ‚úÖ All user accounts in organization
- ‚úÖ All SSO connections

**Preserved** (for recovery):
- ‚úÖ Complete backup in `tenant_deletion_backups`
- ‚úÖ Audit trail in `tenant_deletion_audit`

## Recovery Process

If you need to restore a deleted tenant:

1. **Contact Support** with backup ID (provided after deletion)
2. **Within 30 days** of deletion
3. **Support will use restore API**:
   ```bash
   POST /api/admin/tenant-deletion/restore
   {
     "backupId": "your_backup_id_here"
   }
   ```

## Production Deployment Checklist

Before enabling in production:

- [ ] Test on staging environment
- [ ] Verify backup creation works
- [ ] Test restoration process
- [ ] Set up backup retention policy (30 days)
- [ ] Configure automated backup cleanup
- [ ] Add role-based access control (admin only)
- [ ] Set up deletion notifications (email, Slack, etc.)
- [ ] Document recovery process for support team
- [ ] Add rate limiting to prevent accidental rapid deletions
- [ ] Consider adding extra confirmation step for production

## Customization Options

### Add Email Notifications

In `src/lib/services/tenant-deletion.ts`, add to `logDeletion()`:
```typescript
// Send email notification
await sendEmail({
  to: 'admin@company.com',
  subject: `Organization Deleted: ${orgName}`,
  body: `Organization ${orgName} was deleted by ${deletedBy} at ${timestamp}`
})
```

### Add Role-Based Access Control

In API routes, add:
```typescript
// Check if user has admin role
const isAdmin = await checkUserRole(userId, 'admin')
if (!isAdmin) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Admin access required' }, { status: 403 })
}
```

### Add Slack Notifications

```typescript
await fetch(process.env.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL, {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    text: `üóëÔ∏è Organization Deleted: ${orgName}\nDeleted by: ${userId}\nRecords: ${deletedRecords}`
  })
})
```

## Known Limitations

1. **WorkOS Organization Deletion**
   - Requires WorkOS API key with organization delete permissions
   - May fail if users have active sessions

2. **Backup Size**
   - Large organizations may have large backups
   - Consider implementing backup compression

3. **Deletion Time**
   - Large organizations may take several minutes
   - Consider implementing background job processing

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Background job processing for large deletions
- [ ] Scheduled deletion (delete at specific time)
- [ ] Partial deletion (specific modules only)
- [ ] Deletion analytics and reporting
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication for deletion
- [ ] Webhook notifications
- [ ] Export backup as downloadable file

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Review logs in browser console and server output
- Check `tenant_deletion_audit` collection for deletion history
- Contact development team with backup ID for recovery
