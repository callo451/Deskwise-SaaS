### Phase 3: Chrome Extension Adaptation ✅ COMPLETE

**Extension Files Updated:**

16. **`extension/deskwise-recorder/background.js`** (Complete rewrite - 719 lines)

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ API configuration: `API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:9002'`
- ✅ Session creation on recording start
- ✅ Screenshot upload to new GridFS endpoint
- ✅ Step creation via new API with screenshot references
- ✅ Article generation using new endpoint
- ✅ Graceful degradation with local fallback pages
- ✅ Proper async/await patterns throughout
- ✅ Enhanced error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Session state tracking with `sessionCreated` flag

**New Workflow Implemented:**

```
1. User clicks "Start Recording"
   → POST /api/knowledge-base/recorder/sessions
   → Backend creates session in MongoDB
   → Extension receives sessionId

2. User clicks elements on page
   → Content script captures click event
   → Background script captures screenshot
   → Crops screenshot with visual indicator
   → POST /api/knowledge-base/recorder/screenshots (base64 → GridFS)
   → Receives screenshotId and URL
   → POST /api/knowledge-base/recorder/steps (with screenshotId)
   → Step saved to database

3. User clicks "Stop Recording"
   → POST /api/knowledge-base/recorder/generate
   → AI generates article from steps
   → Article saved to kb_articles
   → Session updated to "completed"
   → New tab opens with generated article
```

**Fallback Behavior:**
- If backend is offline, extension continues locally
- Steps and screenshots saved to Chrome storage
- Local HTML page generated on stop
- No crashes or data loss

    - Positioned next to "New Article" button
    - Maintains existing layout and functionality

## Technical Architecture

### API Data Flow

```
Extension (Chrome)
  ↓ credentials: 'include'
Next.js API Routes
  ↓ NextAuth JWT cookie
Session Validation (getServerSession)
  ↓ orgId + userId
Service Layer (RecorderService)
  ↓ MongoDB queries with orgId filter
Database Collections
  ↓
GridFS (for screenshots)
```

### Multi-Tenancy Enforcement

Every API route enforces organization-scoped access:

```typescript
const session = await getServerSession(authOptions)
if (!session?.user?.orgId) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 })
}

// All queries filtered by orgId
const data = await RecorderService.getSteps(sessionId, session.user.orgId)
```

### Screenshot Storage

- Base64 images uploaded via API
- Converted to Buffer server-side
- Stored in MongoDB GridFS
- Metadata saved to `recorder_screenshots` collection
- Images retrieved via `/api/knowledge-base/recorder/screenshots/[gridfsId]`
- Proper Content-Type headers set
- Immutable cache headers (1 year)

### AI Article Generation

```typescript
1. Fetch session data (title, URL, description)
2. Fetch all steps (ordered by stepNumber)
3. Fetch all screenshots (matched by stepNumber)
4. Build context string from steps
5. Call Gemini API with structured prompt
6. Parse response into markdown
7. Append screenshots section with image embeds
8. Create KB article with recordingMetadata
9. Link article to session
10. Update session status to "completed"
```

---

## How to Test

Follow the comprehensive **TESTING_GUIDE.md** document for step-by-step testing instructions.

### Quick Start

1. **Start backend:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Load extension:**
   - Open `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select `extension/deskwise-recorder` folder

3. **Test recording:**
   - Navigate to any website
   - Click extension icon
   - Start recording
   - Click some elements
   - Stop recording
   - Verify article is generated

4. **View sessions:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:9002/knowledge/sessions`
   - Click on a session to view details

---

## Known Considerations

### CORS Configuration

You may need to add CORS headers to allow extension requests. See TESTING_GUIDE.md for configuration options.

### NextAuth Cookie Settings

Extension must be able to access NextAuth JWT cookie. May need to adjust cookie settings in production:

```typescript
// In src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
cookies: {
  sessionToken: {
    name: 'next-auth.session-token',
    options: {
      httpOnly: true,
      sameSite: 'lax', // or 'none' for cross-origin
      secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
    },
  },
}
```

### Extension Permissions

Ensure manifest.json has required permissions:
- `activeTab` - Capture visible tab screenshots
- `storage` - Store session data locally
- `scripting` - Inject content scripts
- Host permissions for `http://localhost:9002/*`

### GridFS Performance

For large-scale production:
- Consider adding MongoDB indexes on `metadata.sessionId`
- Monitor GridFS chunk size (default 255KB)
- Implement image compression if needed
- Add CDN for screenshot serving

---

## Success Metrics

**Implementation Phase:**
- ✅ 100% of planned features implemented
- ✅ 0 TypeScript errors in codebase
- ✅ All API routes created and structured correctly
- ✅ All frontend pages created with proper UI/UX
- ✅ Extension code updated with new workflow
