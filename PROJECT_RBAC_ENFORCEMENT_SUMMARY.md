# Project Management RBAC Enforcement - Implementation Summary

**Phase 1 (Week 3-4): Add RBAC Enforcement to Existing Project API Routes**

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive RBAC enforcement across all project management API routes. All routes now check appropriate permissions before allowing operations, with context-aware permission checking for scoped permissions (own, assigned, all).

## Routes Updated: 10 Total

### 1. GET /api/projects
**File:** `src/app/api/projects/route.ts`

**Permission Checks:**
- Checks `projects.view.all`, `projects.view.own`, OR `projects.view.assigned`
- Returns 403 Forbidden if user has none of these permissions

**Scoped Filtering Logic:**
```typescript
// If user has view.all - no filtering (sees all projects)
// If user has view.own only - filters to projects where user is PM
// If user has view.assigned only - filters to projects where user is team member
// If user has both view.own and view.assigned - shows projects where user is PM OR team member
```

**Changes:**
- Added imports for `ProjectPermissionService` and `requirePermission`
- Added permission checks before fetching projects
- Implemented query filter modification based on scoped permissions
- Properly handles MongoDB `$or` queries for combined scopes

---

### 2. POST /api/projects
**File:** `src/app/api/projects/route.ts`

**Permission Checks:**
- Requires `projects.create` permission
- Returns 403 Forbidden if missing

**Changes:**
- Added permission check immediately after authentication
- Clear error message indicating missing permission

---

### 3. GET /api/projects/[id]
**File:** `src/app/api/projects/[id]/route.ts`

**Permission Checks:**
- Context-aware check using `ProjectPermissionService.canViewProject(session, project)`
- Checks `projects.view.all`, `projects.view.own` (if user is PM), OR `projects.view.assigned` (if user is team member)
- Returns 403 Forbidden if user doesn't have access to this specific project

**Changes:**
- Added imports for `ProjectPermissionService` and `requirePermission`
- Fetches project first (before permission check)
- Calls `canViewProject()` with project context
- Permission check happens AFTER verifying project exists (404 vs 403 precedence)

---

### 4. PUT /api/projects/[id]
**File:** `src/app/api/projects/[id]/route.ts`

**Permission Checks:**
- Context-aware check using `ProjectPermissionService.canEditProject(session, project)`
- Checks `projects.edit.all` OR `projects.edit.own` (if user is PM)
- Returns 403 Forbidden if user doesn't have edit access

**Changes:**
- Fetches existing project BEFORE parsing request body (for permission check)
- Calls `canEditProject()` with project context
- Maintains existing date conversion logic
- Clear error messages for each failure scenario

---

### 5. DELETE /api/projects/[id]
**File:** `src/app/api/projects/[id]/route.ts`

**Permission Checks:**
- Requires `projects.delete` permission
- Returns 403 Forbidden if missing

**Changes:**
- Added permission check before deletion
- Uses `ProjectPermissionService.canDeleteProjects()` helper

---

### 6. GET /api/projects/stats
**File:** `src/app/api/projects/stats/route.ts`

**Permission Checks:**
- Requires `projects.analytics.view` permission
- Returns 403 Forbidden if missing

**Changes:**
- Added import for `requirePermission`
- Added permission check before fetching statistics
- Clear error message for analytics access denial

---

### 7. GET /api/projects/[id]/tasks
**File:** `src/app/api/projects/[id]/tasks/route.ts`

**Permission Checks:**
- Inherits project view permissions (no separate task view permission)
- Uses `ProjectPermissionService.canViewProject(session, project)`
- Returns 403 Forbidden if user can't view parent project

**Changes:**
- Added imports for `ProjectPermissionService` and `requirePermission`
- Fetches parent project before returning tasks
- Verifies project exists (404) before permission check (403)

---

### 8. POST /api/projects/[id]/tasks
**File:** `src/app/api/projects/[id]/tasks/route.ts`

**Permission Checks:**
- Requires `projects.tasks.create` permission
- Also verifies parent project exists
- Returns 403 Forbidden if missing permission

**Changes:**
- Fetches parent project to verify it exists
- Checks `projects.tasks.create` permission
- Clear error messages

---

### 9. PUT /api/projects/[id]/tasks/[taskId]
**File:** `src/app/api/projects/[id]/tasks/[taskId]/route.ts`

**Permission Checks:**
- Context-aware check using `ProjectPermissionService.canEditTask(session, task)`
- Checks `projects.tasks.edit.all` OR `projects.tasks.edit.assigned` (if user is assignee)
- Returns 403 Forbidden if user can't edit this specific task

**Changes:**
- Added imports for `ProjectPermissionService` and `requirePermission`
- Fetches parent project to verify it exists
- Fetches all tasks and finds the specific task to check
- Calls `canEditTask()` with task context
- Permission check happens before parsing request body
- Maintains existing date conversion logic

**Note:** Since there's no `getTaskById()` method in ProjectService, we fetch all tasks and filter. Consider optimizing this in the future.

---

### 10. DELETE /api/projects/[id]/tasks/[taskId]
**File:** `src/app/api/projects/[id]/tasks/[taskId]/route.ts`

**Permission Checks:**
- Requires `projects.tasks.delete` permission
- Also verifies parent project exists
- Returns 403 Forbidden if missing permission

**Changes:**
- Fetches parent project to verify it exists
- Checks `projects.tasks.delete` permission
- Clear error messages

---

## Permission Hierarchy

All routes now follow this pattern:

1. **Authentication Check** (401 Unauthorized)
   - Verify session exists
   - Verify orgId exists

2. **Resource Existence Check** (404 Not Found)
   - Verify project/task exists
   - Verify it belongs to the organization

3. **Permission Check** (403 Forbidden)
   - Check required permission(s)
   - For scoped permissions, check context (PM, team member, assignee)

4. **Business Logic**
   - Proceed with operation if all checks pass

## Error Response Format

All permission failures now return consistent responses:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Forbidden: You do not have permission to [action]"
}
```

Status code: **403 Forbidden** (not 401 Unauthorized)

## Backward Compatibility

- All routes maintain existing functionality
- No breaking changes to request/response format
- Existing filters (status, clientId, search) still work
- Date conversion logic preserved

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Test Scoped View Permissions
```bash
# User with projects.view.all should see all projects
GET /api/projects

# User with projects.view.own should only see projects they manage
GET /api/projects

# User with projects.view.assigned should only see projects they're assigned to
GET /api/projects

# User with both should see projects they manage OR are assigned to
GET /api/projects
```

### 2. Test Context-Aware Edit Permissions
```bash
# User with projects.edit.all can edit any project
PUT /api/projects/{id}

# User with projects.edit.own can only edit projects they manage
PUT /api/projects/{id}  # where user is PM - should succeed
PUT /api/projects/{id}  # where user is NOT PM - should fail with 403
```

### 3. Test Task Permissions
```bash
# User with projects.tasks.create can create tasks
POST /api/projects/{id}/tasks

# User with projects.tasks.edit.all can edit any task
PUT /api/projects/{id}/tasks/{taskId}

# User with projects.tasks.edit.assigned can only edit tasks assigned to them
PUT /api/projects/{id}/tasks/{taskId}  # where user is assignee - should succeed
PUT /api/projects/{id}/tasks/{taskId}  # where user is NOT assignee - should fail with 403
```

### 4. Test Permission Denial
```bash
# User without any view permissions should get 403
GET /api/projects

# User without create permission should get 403
POST /api/projects

# User without delete permission should get 403
DELETE /api/projects/{id}
```

### 5. Test Edge Cases
```bash
# Non-existent project should return 404 (not 403)
GET /api/projects/000000000000000000000000

# Project from different organization should return 404
GET /api/projects/{different-org-project-id}

# Invalid ObjectId format should return 400 or 500 (not 403)
GET /api/projects/invalid-id
```

## Issues Found in Existing Code

### 1. Missing getTaskById Method
The `ProjectService` doesn't have a `getTaskById()` method, so the PUT task route has to:
1. Fetch all tasks for the project
2. Filter to find the specific task
3. Check permissions

**Recommendation:** Add `ProjectService.getTaskById(taskId, projectId, orgId)` for better performance.

### 2. Inconsistent userId vs id
The session sometimes uses `session.user.id` and sometimes `session.user.userId`. The permission service expects `userId`.

**Current workaround:** The `requirePermission` helper checks both `session.user.id` and converts it appropriately.

### 3. No Project Context in Task Service Methods
Task methods (`updateTask`, `deleteTask`) don't return the task object with full context (assignedTo, etc.), making it harder to check context-aware permissions.

**Current workaround:** We fetch all tasks first to get context before calling update/delete.

## Permission Service Helpers Used

From `src/lib/services/project-permissions.ts`:

- `ProjectPermissionService.canViewAllProjects(session)` - Check if user can view all projects
- `ProjectPermissionService.canViewProject(session, project)` - Context-aware view check
- `ProjectPermissionService.canEditProject(session, project)` - Context-aware edit check
- `ProjectPermissionService.canDeleteProjects(session)` - Check delete permission
- `ProjectPermissionService.canEditTask(session, task)` - Context-aware task edit check

From `src/lib/middleware/permissions.ts`:

- `requirePermission(session, permission)` - Check single permission
- Returns boolean, works with cached session permissions

## Next Steps

1. **Test all routes** with different permission combinations
2. **Add unit tests** for permission checks
3. **Add integration tests** for API routes
4. **Consider adding** `getTaskById()` to ProjectService for better performance
5. **Update frontend** to handle 403 responses appropriately
6. **Add permission checks** to milestone and other project sub-routes
7. **Document permissions** for frontend developers

## Summary Statistics
