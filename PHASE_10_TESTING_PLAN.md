# Phase 10: Testing and ITIL Compliance Validation

## Overview
This phase validates that the unified ticketing system maintains ITIL compliance and all functionality works correctly across all ticket types.

## Testing Categories

### 1. Database Migration Validation ✅
- [x] Verify 42 records migrated successfully
- [x] Confirm zero null ticketNumber or orgId values
- [x] Validate auto-generated ticket numbers (TKT-, INC-, CHG-, SR-, PRB-)
- [x] Check 9 indexes created for query optimization
- [x] Verify legacy collections archived with timestamps

**Results**: All checks passed. Migration successful.

2. **Metadata Validation**: Some legacy metadata fields may have inconsistent structure
3. **Service Catalog**: Existing catalog items may need category updates

---

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues are found:

1. Drop `unified_tickets` collection
2. Restore from archived collections:
   - `tickets_legacy_2025-10-19T07-36-40-575Z`
   - `incidents_legacy_2025-10-19T07-36-40-575Z`
   - `change_requests_legacy_2025-10-19T07-36-40-575Z`
   - `incident_updates_legacy_2025-10-19T07-36-40-575Z`
3. Revert API routes to legacy endpoints
4. Restore legacy frontend pages

**Rollback Script**: `scripts/rollback-unified-migration.ts` (to be created if needed)
