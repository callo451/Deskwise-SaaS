## 2. Dashboard Design Patterns

### 2.1 Dashboard Design Principles

#### 2.1.1 Core Design Philosophy

**Clarity and Simplicity**
- Dashboards should be useful, simple, and practical
- Show only the most relevant information
- Avoid overwhelming users with excessive data ("analysis paralysis")
- Enable better decision-making at a glance

**The "8 Ws" Framework**

Modern dashboard design should answer these fundamental questions:

1. **Why:** What is the dashboard's purpose? (monitoring, analysis, reporting)
2. **Who:** Target users and their roles (executive, manager, technician, end-user)
3. **What:** Critical information and questions to answer
4. **When:** Information cadence and timing (real-time, daily, weekly)
5. **Where:** Visual hierarchy and positioning of elements
6. **Which:** Related dashboards and layered design
7. **What's optional:** Configurable elements for personalization
8. **Workflow:** How the dashboard integrates with user workflows

#### 2.1.2 Visual Design Best Practices

**Layout and Organization**
- **Eye Movement Patterns:** Design follows natural "Z" or "F" reading patterns
- **Logical Arrangement:** Items organized to help users find information quickly
- **Hierarchy:** Most critical KPIs in primary viewing area (top-left for F-pattern)
- **White Space:** Adequate spacing prevents cluttered appearance

**Color and Visual Coding**
- **Intuitive Color Palettes:**
  - Green: Good/healthy/within targets
  - Yellow/Amber: Warning/approaching thresholds
  - Red: Critical/exceeded thresholds
  - Blue: Informational/neutral metrics
- **Consistent Application:** Color meanings remain consistent across all dashboards
- **Accessibility:** Consider color-blind friendly palettes (avoid red-green only)

**Typography and Readability**
- **Font Hierarchy:** Clear distinction between titles, labels, and data values
- **Size Appropriateness:** Large enough to read from typical viewing distance
- **Data Density:** Balance between information richness and readability

### 2.2 Widget Types and Applications

  - Add context with color coding (red/yellow/green)
  - Show comparison to target or historical average
- **Example:** "Open P1 Incidents: 3 ↓ (Target: <5)"

**Gauge Charts**
- **Use Cases:** Show progress toward a goal, display KPIs with thresholds
- **Best Practices:**
  - Pair with time series for historical context
  - Define clear threshold zones (red/yellow/green)
  - Use sparingly (space-intensive for single metric)
  - Consider replacing multiple gauges with column chart + threshold lines
- **Example:** SLA compliance gauge (0-100%) with zones: 0-90% red, 90-95% yellow, 95-100% green

#### 2.2.2 Charts for Trends and Comparisons

**Line Charts**
- **Use Cases:** Show trends over time, multiple metric comparison
- **Best Practices:**
  - Limit to 3-5 lines for readability

  - Combine time, numerical, and categorical axes strategically
- **Strategic Value:** Turn raw data into instant insight; natural pattern recognition through color

**Pie/Donut Charts**
- **Use Cases:** Show part-to-whole relationships (limited categories)
- **Best Practices:**
  - Limit to 5-7 categories maximum
  - Order by size (largest to smallest)
  - Consider bar chart alternative for better comparison
  - Use donut variant to display central summary metric
- **Examples:** Ticket distribution by status, asset distribution by location

#### 2.2.4 Tables and Lists

**Data Tables**
- **Use Cases:** Display detailed records requiring precise values
- **Best Practices:**
  - Enable sorting, filtering, pagination
  - Highlight critical values with color coding
  - Include drill-down links to detail views
  - Limit visible rows (10-20) with pagination
- **Examples:** Top 10 unresolved incidents, recent changes, aging tickets

**Sparklines**
- **Use Cases:** Show micro-trends within tables or alongside KPIs

- **Column Chart:** Time-based comparisons (e.g., monthly ticket volume)
- **Grouped Bar:** Multiple metrics per category (e.g., tickets created vs. resolved by month)
- **Bullet Chart:** Compare actual vs. target with qualitative ranges

**Avoid:**
- Pie charts for >5 categories
- 3D charts (distort perception)

#### 6.1.2 Distribution

**Use Case:** Show how values are distributed

**Best Chart Types:**
- **Histogram:** Frequency distribution (e.g., resolution time distribution)
- **Box Plot:** Statistical distribution with quartiles and outliers
- **Scatter Plot:** Relationship between two variables (e.g., ticket volume vs. CSAT)

#### 6.1.3 Trends Over Time

**Use Case:** Show changes over time

**Best Chart Types:**
- **Line Chart:** Continuous trends (e.g., daily ticket volume)
- **Area Chart:** Cumulative trends or part-to-whole over time
- **Sparkline:** Micro-trend embedded in tables or cards

**Best Practices:**
- Start Y-axis at zero (unless showing small variations)
- Include trend lines or moving averages for noisy data
- Add reference lines for targets or thresholds

#### 6.1.4 Part-to-Whole

**Use Case:** Show composition or percentage breakdown

**Best Chart Types:**
- **Pie/Donut Chart:** Simple composition (≤5 categories)
- **Stacked Bar Chart:** Composition across categories or time
- **Treemap:** Hierarchical part-to-whole with many categories

**Best Practices:**
- Order segments by size
- Use consistent color coding
- Include percentage labels

#### 6.1.5 Relationships and Correlations

**Use Case:** Show connections between variables

**Best Chart Types:**
- **Scatter Plot:** Two-variable correlation (e.g., technician workload vs. CSAT)
- **Bubble Chart:** Three-variable relationships (size = third variable)
- **Heatmap:** Correlation matrix or pattern identification

### 6.2 Color Strategy

#### 6.2.1 Semantic Color Coding

**Status Indicators:**
- Green (#10B981): Healthy, on-target, good
- Yellow/Amber (#F59E0B): Warning, approaching threshold
- Red (#EF4444): Critical, exceeded threshold, failed
- Blue (#3B82F6): Informational, neutral, in-progress
- Gray (#6B7280): Inactive, disabled, not applicable

**Consistency:**
- Maintain color meanings across all dashboards and reports
- Document color standards in style guide
- Apply consistently to text, backgrounds, and chart elements

#### 6.2.2 Accessibility

**Color-Blind Friendly Palettes:**
- Avoid red-green only indicators

- Test with color-blindness simulation tools

**Contrast Ratios:**
- WCAG AA compliance: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- High contrast between text and background
- Avoid light gray text on white backgrounds

#### 6.2.3 Data Visualization Palettes

**Categorical Data (Distinct Categories):**
- Use distinct hues for each category
- Limit to 6-8 colors maximum
- Example palette: Blue, Orange, Green, Red, Purple, Brown, Pink, Gray

**Sequential Data (Ordered Values):**
- Single hue with varying lightness
- Example: Light blue → Medium blue → Dark blue
- Use for heatmaps, choropleth maps

**Diverging Data (Data with Meaningful Midpoint):**
- Two contrasting hues meeting at neutral midpoint
- Example: Red ← White → Blue (negative to positive)
- Use for variance analysis, performance vs. target
