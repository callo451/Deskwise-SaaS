## Executive Summary

### Current State Assessment

**Phase 1 Status:** 60% Complete
- ✅ Basic CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- ✅ Simple status workflow (new → open → pending → resolved → closed)
- ✅ Priority levels (low, medium, high, critical)
- ✅ Assignment and requester tracking
- ✅ Basic SLA tracking (response/resolution times)
- ✅ Comments and activity logging
- ✅ Simple search and filtering
- ✅ Basic statistics dashboard

**Critical Gaps Identified:**
- ❌ **No ITIL v4 alignment** - No separation of Incidents vs Service Requests
- ❌ **No email integration** - Cannot create tickets from email
- ❌ **No auto-assignment** - Manual routing only
- ❌ **No SLA escalation** - Breaches are tracked but ignored
- ❌ **No automation** - No triggers, macros, or workflows
- ❌ **No AI features** - Gemini 2.0 available but unused
- ❌ **No custom fields** - Rigid data model
- ❌ **No KB integration** - No article suggestions or ticket deflection
- ❌ **No time tracking** - Cannot log billable hours
- ❌ **No ticket relationships** - Cannot link, merge, or split tickets
- ❌ **No email notifications** - Users unaware of updates
- ❌ **No canned responses** - Technicians retype common answers
- ❌ **No attachment management** - Limited file handling
- ❌ **Weak RBAC enforcement** - Permissions exist but not checked

**Competitive Analysis:**
- **ServiceNow:** 4.8/5 (96%) - Industry leader
- **Jira Service Management:** 4.5/5 (90%) - Strong developer integration
- **Freshservice:** 4.3/5 (86%) - Excellent UX
