## 🟡 PHASE 2: ENHANCEMENT (Months 3-4) - IN PROGRESS

### AI & Automation (Quick Wins)

#### 1. AI Auto-Classification (Week 1-2) 🔥 HIGH PRIORITY
- [ ] Gemini API integration for ticket analysis
- [ ] Auto-suggest category based on subject/description
- [ ] Auto-suggest priority based on keywords (urgent, critical, down, outage)
- [ ] Auto-suggest assignment group based on category
- [ ] Show AI suggestions to agent (manual confirm or auto-apply)
- [ ] Track AI accuracy metrics (target: 95%+)

**Technical Approach:**
```typescript
// API endpoint: POST /api/ai/classify-ticket
async function classifyTicket(subject: string, description: string) {
  const prompt = `Analyze this IT support ticket and suggest:
  1. Category (Hardware, Software, Network, Security, Other)
  2. Priority (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
  3. Assignment Group (Desktop Support, Network Team, Security Team, etc.)

  Subject: ${subject}
  Description: ${description}

  Return JSON format.`

  const result = await gemini.generateContent(prompt)
  return JSON.parse(result.response.text())
}
```

#### 2. Canned Responses/Macros (Week 2-3) 🔥 HIGH PRIORITY
- [ ] Macro data model (MongoDB collection)
  - [ ] Name, description, content (rich text)
  - [ ] Actions (update status, add comment, reassign, etc.)
  - [ ] Shared vs personal macros
  - [ ] Category/tags for organization
- [ ] Macro management UI (admin)
  - [ ] Create, edit, delete macros
  - [ ] Template variables: {{ticket.id}}, {{user.name}}, {{agent.name}}
  - [ ] Preview macro before applying
- [ ] Macro application (agent console)
  - [ ] Macro dropdown/search in ticket view
  - [ ] One-click apply macro
  - [ ] Execute all actions (comment + status update + notify)
- [ ] Default macro templates (30+ templates)
  - [ ] Password reset instructions
  - [ ] Request more information
  - [ ] Escalate to supervisor
  - [ ] Close as resolved
  - [ ] Close as duplicate

**Data Model:**
```typescript
interface Macro {
  _id: ObjectId
  orgId: string
  name: string
  description?: string
  content: string  // Rich text with variables
  actions: MacroAction[]
  visibility: 'shared' | 'personal'
  createdBy: string
  category?: string
  tags?: string[]
}

interface MacroAction {
  type: 'update_status' | 'add_comment' | 'assign' | 'add_tag' | 'send_email'
  value: any
}
```

#### 3. SLA Multi-Level Escalation (Week 3-4) 🔥 HIGH PRIORITY
- [ ] Escalation levels (up to 4 levels)
  - [ ] Level 1: 80% SLA → Email assigned agent
  - [ ] Level 2: 90% SLA → Email agent + supervisor
  - [ ] Level 3: 100% SLA → Email agent + supervisor + manager (auto-reassign)
  - [ ] Level 4: 120% SLA → Email escalation to director/VP
- [ ] Escalation configuration per SLA policy
  - [ ] Threshold percentage (80%, 90%, 100%, 120%)
  - [ ] Recipient roles/users per level
  - [ ] Actions: email, reassign, update priority
- [ ] Escalation email templates
- [ ] Escalation history/audit log
- [ ] Prevent duplicate escalations (track "escalated" flag)

**Backend Logic:**
```typescript
// Run every 5 minutes via cron job
async function checkSLAEscalations() {
  const openTickets = await db.collection('tickets').find({
    status: { $nin: ['Closed', 'Resolved'] }
  }).toArray()

  for (const ticket of openTickets) {
    const slaStatus = calculateSLAStatus(ticket)

    if (slaStatus.percentage >= 80 && !ticket.escalations?.includes('level1')) {
      await escalateTicket(ticket, 'level1')
    }
    if (slaStatus.percentage >= 90 && !ticket.escalations?.includes('level2')) {
      await escalateTicket(ticket, 'level2')
    }
    // ... level 3, level 4
  }
}
```

  - [ ] Set delay (send immediately vs 1 hour after resolution)

**Target Metrics:**
- 20%+ survey response rate
- 85%+ CSAT score
- Track NPS (Net Promoter Score)

#### 5. KB Article Suggestions (Week 4) 🔥 HIGH PRIORITY
- [ ] Search KB based on ticket subject/description
- [ ] Show top 5 relevant articles during ticket creation
- [ ] "Did this solve your issue?" option
  - [ ] Yes → Don't create ticket (deflection)
  - [ ] No → Continue to ticket form

- [ ] Dependent dropdowns
  - [ ] Category → Subcategory → Item (cascade)
- [ ] Conditional required fields
  - [ ] If issue type = "Bug" → "Steps to reproduce" required
- [ ] Form templates per request type

**Implementation Example:**
```typescript
interface CustomField {
  id: string
