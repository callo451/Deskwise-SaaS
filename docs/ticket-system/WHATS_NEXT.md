## 📋 Next Steps (In Order)

### Step 1: Database Index Creation (15 minutes)

**Option A: Node.js Script (Recommended)**
```bash
# Set your MongoDB connection string
export MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://your-connection-string"

# Run the script
node scripts/create-ticket-indexes.js
```

**Option B: MongoDB Shell**
```bash
mongosh "mongodb+srv://your-connection-string" --file scripts/create-ticket-indexes.mongodb.js
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✓ Connected successfully
📁 Collection: time_entries
  ✓ org_ticket_running_idx - Created
  ...
Total indexes created: 23
```

---

### Step 2: Create Test Data (10 minutes)

```bash
# Optional: Specify organization and user IDs
export ORG_ID="your-org-id"
export USER_ID="your-admin-user-id"

- Data corruption or loss
- Widespread errors (>5% error rate)

**Rollback Steps:**

1. **Revert application code**
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push production main
   ```

2. **Drop new indexes (optional)**
   ```bash
   # Only if indexes causing performance issues
   node scripts/rollback-indexes.js
   ```

3. **Restore database backup (extreme)**
   ```bash
   # Only if data corruption occurred
   mongorestore --uri="mongodb://prod-uri" --drop /backup/prod-YYYYMMDD
   ```

4. **Communicate with users**
   ```
   Subject: Service Restoration

   We've temporarily rolled back recent updates due to technical issues.
   Your data is safe and the system is fully operational.
   We'll reschedule the deployment after addressing these issues.
   ```

A: No, it's optional for local testing. Recommended for staging/production.

**Q: What if index creation fails?**
A: Check MongoDB logs, verify disk space, try creating indexes one at a time.

**Q: Can I test features without creating test data?**
A: Yes, but test data makes testing much faster and more comprehensive.

**Q: How long does staging testing take?**
A: Minimum 2-3 hours for thorough testing. More if issues found.

**Q: Is downtime required for deployment?**
A: No, indexes are created in background. Zero downtime deployment.

**Q: What if users report bugs after deployment?**
