## Key Research Findings (2025)

### 1. AI/Automation is the Primary Differentiator

**Industry Leaders:**
- **ServiceNow:** Agentic AI with Task Intelligence - auto-classifies incidents, suggests solutions, summarizes conversations
- **Jira Service Management:** Atlassian Intelligence - summarizes tickets, writes replies, virtual agent for common requests
- **Freshservice:** Freddy AI - virtual agent, auto-categorization, canned response suggestions
- **Zendesk:** Auto-assist procedures with macro suggestions

**Impact Metrics:**
- 38-55% ticket reduction through AI virtual agents (Moveworks at Broadcom: 6,000 tickets/month automated)
- 95%+ accuracy in AI-based classification and routing
- 70% response time reduction (IBM Watson Assistant)
- Gartner prediction: 70% of enterprise service interactions resolved by AI by 2030

### 2. SLA Management Remains Critical

**Industry Standards:**
- Multi-level escalation (up to 4 levels)
- Business hours configuration with holiday calendars
- Proactive breach warnings at 80%, 90%, 100% thresholds
- SLA pause/resume for "waiting on user" status
- Separate SLAs by priority, service, customer segment

**Target Compliance:** 95%+ SLA adherence is industry standard for top performers

### 3. ITIL v4 Alignment is Non-Negotiable

**Key Practices:**
- **Incident Management:** Unplanned interruptions requiring immediate restoration
- **Service Request Fulfillment:** Planned requests from service catalog
- **Service Desk as SPOC:** Single point of contact for all IT needs
- **Knowledge-Centered Service:** 30-50% ticket deflection through self-service KB

**Critical Distinction:**
- Incidents = errors/outages (restore service quickly)
- Service Requests = catalog items (password reset, software access)

### 4. Modern UX Drives Adoption

**2025 UX Trends:**
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Reveal info in layers to reduce cognitive load
- **Contextual Intelligence:** Personalize UI by role (Oracle ERP: 36% task completion boost)
- **AI-First Interfaces:** Smart suggestions, auto-complete, predictive fields
- **Clean, Modern Design:** Card-based layouts, minimalist interface (Zammad praised for UX)
- **Mobile-First:** Responsive design with native apps for field technicians

**Portal Best Practices:**
- Max 3 clicks to any feature
- "Get Help" button vs "Submit Ticket" (jargon-free language)
- WCAG 2.0 compliant for accessibility
- Prominent search with KB article suggestions before ticket creation

### 5. Workflow Automation is Essential

**Three Automation Types:**

1. **Triggers (Event-Based):** Run on ticket create/update
   - Example: Send email notification on assignment
   - Zendesk: Checks triggers on every ticket update

2. **Scheduled Automations (Time-Based):** Run hourly/daily
   - Example: Close stale tickets after 7 days of inactivity
   - Zendesk: Runs hourly to check conditions

3. **Macros (One-Click Actions):** Agent-initiated shortcuts
   - Example: "Resolve and notify" = update status + send email + close ticket
   - Zendesk: Personal macros vs shared macros

**No-Code Requirement:** Visual workflow builders are standard (drag-drop, if-then-else logic)
